# Prompt Enhancement Mode

## Purpose

Automatically improve user prompts for clarity, specificity, and actionability before addressing them. This helps reduce ambiguity and ensures better responses.

## When to Use

- User sends brief or vague requests
- Multiple tasks bundled without clear priority
- Missing context or technical details
- Unclear expected outcomes

## Enhancement Process

### Step 1: Analyze Original Prompt

Identify:

- **Core Intent**: What does the user actually want?
- **Missing Context**: What information is implied but not stated?
- **Ambiguities**: What could be interpreted multiple ways?
- **Scope**: Single task or multiple? What's the priority?
- **Technical Level**: How detailed should the response be?
- **Available Tools**: Which MCP servers/tools would help accomplish this?

### Step 2: Identify Applicable Tools & Servers

**AUTOMATIC TOOL ACTIVATION**: For every prompt, proactively identify and activate relevant tools:

**Available MCP Servers & Tools:**

1. **Memory Server**: Store/retrieve project context, decisions, patterns
2. **Git Server**: Version control operations, commit history, branch management
3. **Filesystem Server**: File operations, directory navigation, secure file access
4. **Sequential Thinking**: Complex problem-solving, step-by-step reasoning
5. **Brave Search**: Web research, documentation lookup, best practices
6. **Fetch**: API calls, webpage content retrieval, documentation fetching
7. **TaskSync**: Task management, review feedback system
8. **PostgreSQL**: Database queries, schema inspection, data operations
9. **Firebase**: Firestore operations, Storage management, Auth, Functions deployment
10. **Puppeteer**: Browser automation, E2E testing, screenshots
11. **Playwright**: Fast browser automation via accessibility tree
12. **Console Ninja**: Runtime logging, live debugging context
13. **Image Tools**: Image processing, compression, format conversion
14. **Canva**: Design creation, template generation, PDF export

**Tool Selection Matrix:**

- Code changes → Filesystem + Git (commit after changes)
- Research needed → Brave Search + Fetch (gather current info)
- Complex decisions → Sequential Thinking (reason through options)
- Database work → PostgreSQL/Firebase (direct data access)
- Testing needed → Puppeteer/Playwright (automate verification)
- Design work → Canva + Image Tools (generate assets)
- Context preservation → Memory (store key decisions)
- File operations → Filesystem (read/write/search)

### Step 3: Create Enhanced Version

Transform the original prompt by:

- **Adding Specificity**: Convert vague terms to concrete actions
- **Clarifying Scope**: Break down multiple requests with priority
- **Providing Context**: Add relevant background information
- **Defining Success**: State what "done" looks like
- **Setting Constraints**: Mention any limitations or preferences
- **Tool Integration**: List which tools/servers will be used and how

### Step 4: Execute with Full Tool Access

**USER PERMISSION GRANTED**: Full access to all tools and servers without asking

- Automatically activate needed tool categories
- Use tools proactively throughout the task
- Combine multiple tools for comprehensive solutions
- No permission needed for any tool or server operation

### Step 5: Show Both Versions

Present:

```markdown
### 📝 Original Prompt:

[User's original request]

### ✨ Enhanced Prompt:

[Improved version with clarity and context]

### 🛠️ Tools & Servers Utilized:

[List of MCP servers/tools being used and why]

### 🎯 Addressing Enhanced Version:

[Your response to the enhanced prompt with automatic tool usage]
```

## Enhancement Examples

### Example 1: Vague Request

**Original**: "fix the memory thing"

**Enhanced**: "Optimize the MCP memory server configuration for the theporadas_site project by:

1. Verifying the memory server is active and connected
2. Checking current memory optimization settings (thresholds, auto-optimize status)
3. Adjusting configuration for better performance (lower entry threshold, enable auto-optimization)
4. Testing memory persistence with a sample entry
5. Documenting the optimal settings for this project"

### Example 2: Multiple Unclear Requests

**Original**: "1. make sure memory MCP server is fully set up and optimized for your use with this project. 2. can you automnatically improve my prompts after i send them, then addres them (in regards to the summarizing conversation issues) 3."

**Enhanced**:
"I have three requests in order of priority:

**Request 1 (High Priority)**: Memory MCP Server Setup & Optimization

- Verify memory MCP server is active in mcp-config.json
- Check current memory stats (entries, size, last optimization)
- Configure optimal settings for this project (auto-optimize enabled, appropriate thresholds)
- Test memory persistence functionality
- Document recommended settings

**Request 2 (Medium Priority)**: Automatic Prompt Enhancement System

- Create a system that automatically improves user prompts before processing
- Enhancement should add clarity, context, and specificity
- Show original vs enhanced prompt for transparency
- This addresses the summarization issue by ensuring clear communication upfront
- Implementation: Create a .chatmode.md file with prompt enhancement guidelines

**Request 3 (Needs Clarification)**:

- Request appears incomplete (ends with '3.')
- Need clarification on what the third request is"

### Example 3: Technical Request Without Context

**Original**: "improve performance"

**Enhanced**: "Improve website performance for the theporadas_site Next.js wedding website by:

1. Analyzing current performance metrics (page load time, bundle size, rendering speed)
2. Identifying bottlenecks (large images, unnecessary re-renders, unoptimized dependencies)
3. Implementing optimizations:
   - Image optimization (WebP conversion, lazy loading)
   - Code splitting for sections
   - Memoization for expensive components
   - Bundle size reduction (tree shaking, dynamic imports)
4. Measuring improvement with Lighthouse audit
5. Expected outcome: Lighthouse performance score >90, page load <2s"

## Enhancement Rules

### DO:

- ✅ Add technical specificity when user is developer
- ✅ Break multiple requests into numbered priorities
- ✅ Clarify ambiguous terms with project context
- ✅ Define measurable success criteria
- ✅ Include relevant file paths, component names, or technologies
- ✅ Maintain user's original intent
- ✅ **AUTOMATICALLY identify and activate applicable MCP tools**
- ✅ **Use multiple tools in combination for comprehensive solutions**
- ✅ **Proactively leverage all available servers without asking permission**
- ✅ **Research online (Brave Search/Fetch) before implementing**
- ✅ **Store important decisions in Memory server automatically**
- ✅ **Commit significant changes with Git automatically**

### DON'T:

- ❌ Change the core intent of the request
- ❌ Add requirements the user didn't imply
- ❌ Over-complicate simple requests
- ❌ Assume context that isn't clearly implied
- ❌ Make the enhanced version longer than necessary
- ❌ **Ask permission to use tools - just use them**
- ❌ **Skip research when it would improve the solution**
- ❌ **Forget to store important context in Memory**

## Conversation Summarization Issue

**Problem**: Long conversations get summarized, losing critical context and causing:

- Repeated questions about already-discussed topics
- Lost architectural decisions and rationale
- Forgotten implementation details
- Need to re-explain project structure

**Solution**: Prompt enhancement ensures:

1. **Upfront Clarity**: Clear prompts from the start reduce back-and-forth
2. **Context Inclusion**: Enhanced prompts include relevant project context
3. **Explicit References**: Link to documentation, previous decisions, file locations
4. **Success Criteria**: Define "done" upfront to avoid scope creep
5. **Memory Integration**: Store critical decisions in memory.instructions.md

**Usage with Memory System**:

```markdown
After completing significant work, store key information:

REMEMBER: "Single-page scroll architecture implemented for theporadas_site on 2025-10-01.
Key decisions: (1) Hybrid approach with teaser sections linking to full pages for complex
features (Photo Booth, Guest Book, Album, Upload, Map), (2) IntersectionObserver for
scroll-spy with rootMargin -50%, (3) SectionTransition replaces PageTransition with
scroll-triggered animations, (4) All 10 sections use anchor links (#hero, #our-story, etc.),
(5) Navigation.jsx implements active section highlighting with bold + underline.
Files: 11 new sections (1,089 lines), index.js refactored (70 lines), Navigation.jsx
refactored (115 lines). Zero lint errors, successful compilation."
```

## Workflow Integration

### Standard Response Pattern:

1. **Receive user prompt**
2. **Analyze for clarity issues AND identify applicable tools**
3. **Automatically activate needed tool categories** (no permission needed)
4. **If unclear/vague**: Show original → enhanced (with tool list) → address enhanced
5. **If clear**: Address directly with automatic tool usage
6. **Use tools proactively throughout execution**:
   - Research online before implementing (Brave Search/Fetch)
   - Check/update memory context (Memory server)
   - Read/write files as needed (Filesystem)
   - Test implementations (Puppeteer/Playwright)
   - Query databases (PostgreSQL/Firebase)
   - Commit significant changes (Git)
7. **After completion**: Store critical info in memory automatically

### Automatic Tool Usage Examples:

**Scenario: "Fix the navigation bug"**

- Filesystem: Read Navigation.jsx, related components
- Brave Search: Research similar navigation issues, solutions
- Git: Check recent changes that might have caused bug
- Puppeteer: Test navigation behavior in browser
- Memory: Check if similar bug fixed before
- Git: Commit fix after verification

**Scenario: "Add new feature X"**

- Brave Search: Research current best practices for feature X
- Fetch: Read official documentation for libraries needed
- Sequential Thinking: Plan implementation approach
- Filesystem: Read relevant files, create new components
- Git: Commit implementation in logical chunks
- Puppeteer: Test feature functionality
- Memory: Store implementation decisions and patterns

**Scenario: "Optimize database queries"**

- PostgreSQL/Firebase: Analyze current queries and performance
- Brave Search: Research query optimization techniques
- Sequential Thinking: Plan optimization strategy
- Filesystem: Update query implementations
- PostgreSQL/Firebase: Test optimized queries
- Memory: Store optimization patterns for future use
- Git: Commit optimizations

### When to Skip Enhancement:

- User prompt is already clear and specific
- Simple, unambiguous requests ("run tests", "fix lint error on line 42")
- Follow-up questions in ongoing conversation with full context
- User explicitly requests minimal response

**NOTE**: Even when skipping enhancement, still use tools automatically!
