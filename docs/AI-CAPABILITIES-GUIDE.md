### 6. VS Code Agent Mode Enhancements ‚úÖ

**Status:** Fully configured (October 9, 2025)  
**Key Settings:**

- `chat.agent.enabled`: Agent mode available by default
- `chat.todoListTool.enabled`: Enables the experimental todo list surfaced in the Chat view
- `chat.todoListWidget.position = "panel"`: Pins the todo tracker to the right column in the chat UI
- `chat.checkpoints.enabled`: Automatic checkpoints per chat turn
- `chat.mcp.autostart`: Auto-restart MCP servers when configuration changes

**Operator Guidance:**

- Restart or reload VS Code after settings updates to ensure the todo widget renders

- Sensitive files (`.env`, `.secrets/**`) remain protected by `chat.tools.edits.autoApprove`
- Terminal auto-approve list blocks destructive commands (`del`, `rd`, regex for `rm`, `format`)

**When I'll Reference It:**

- When switching into Agent mode to explain live task progress or checkpoint snapshots
- When clarifying why a command was blocked by the auto-approve guardrails
- When reviewing or adjusting the 25-item optimization checklist

**Currently Available:**
