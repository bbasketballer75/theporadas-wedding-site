## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Collection Naming Consistency**
   - Production: `wedding-photos` (hyphen)
   - Tests: `wedding_photos` (underscore)
   - Solution: Support both patterns or standardize

2. **Security Rules Validation**
   - Firestore rules are exact matches (no fuzzy matching)
   - Always test with actual production rule structure
   - Create dedicated test collections for emulator

3. **Parallel Test Execution**
   - Emulator needs longer propagation time (2000ms+)
   - Consider unique collection names per test
   - Sequential execution more reliable (workers: 1)

4. **Field Name Requirements**
   - Match security rules exactly (e.g., `timestamp` not `createdAt`)
   - Validate required fields in tests
   - Document field requirements in rules comments

5. **Cleanup Strategies**
   - Batch deletion (500 docs) for performance
   - Comprehensive collection monitoring
   - Verification steps to catch failures early

### CI/CD Insights

1. **Environment Matching**
   - CI must match local (Java 21 in our case)
   - Emulator caching speeds up CI runs
   - Health checks prevent false failures

2. **Test Isolation**
   - Clear all data before each test suite
   - Wait for propagation after writes
   - Verify cleanup succeeded

### Production Deployment

1. **Auto-Deploy Works**
   - Vercel auto-deploys on push to main
   - Build time: ~50 seconds typical
   - Zero downtime deployments

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Configure once, deploy anywhere
   - Vercel dashboard UI is reliable
   - No .env files needed in production

3. **Monitoring is Critical**
   - Sentry for error tracking
   - Firebase Console for usage
   - Vercel Analytics for performance

- **Status:** Passes on retry
- **Impact:** None (emulator-only)

**2 Timing-Sensitive Tests (Phase 15):**
- **Tests:** Real-time listener updates
- **Issue:** Parallel execution timing
- **Workaround:** Sequential OR longer waits
- **Impact:** Dev/testing only

### Production (None)
No known production issues at this time.
