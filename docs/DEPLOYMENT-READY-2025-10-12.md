## üé® Design System Summary

### Color Palette

```javascript
sage: {
  500: '#4a8c66', // Deep forest green
  600: '#3d7556',
  700: '#305a44'
}
blush: {
  500: '#d4556d', // Deep rose
  600: '#b8445a',
  700: '#963643'
}
gold: {
  500: '#d4af37', // Classic gold
  600: '#b8982f',
  700: '#9c7725'
}
// Warm neutrals
ivory: '#fdfbf7'
champagne: '#f4ede4'
dusty: '#8b7f76'
charcoal: '#2d2d2d'
```

### Component Classes

- `.card-elegant` - Main card styling with depth and shadows
- `.glass-elegant` - Glass morphism effect for overlays
- `.btn-primary` - Sage-to-blush gradient button
- `.btn-secondary` - Transparent with sage border
- `.btn-accent` - White with sage text
- `.text-gradient-elegant` - Sage-to-blush text gradient
- `.shadow-elegant` - Refined shadow
- `.shadow-elegant-lg` - Larger refined shadow
- `.shadow-glow-gold` - Gold glow effect
- `.pattern-dots` - Decorative dot pattern

### Animations

- `float` (6s ease-in-out infinite) - Gentle floating effect
- `fadeIn` (0.8s ease-out) - Smooth fade-in
- `shimmer` (2.5s infinite) - Subtle shimmer effect
- `glow` (2s ease-in-out infinite) - Pulsing glow

## üö¢ Deployment Instructions

### Vercel Dashboard Deployment (Required Method)

Due to Git author configuration mismatch between local commits and Vercel team settings, **you must deploy via the Vercel dashboard**. The CLI method is currently blocked.

#### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Go to your project:** <https://vercel.com/austins-projects-bb7c50ab/wedding-website>
2. **Click the "Deploy" button** in the top right
3. Vercel will automatically pull the latest commit from GitHub (`f51fa32`)
4. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
5. Verify live site at production URL

#### Alternative: Redeploy Existing

1. **Go to Deployments:** <https://vercel.com/austins-projects-bb7c50ab/wedding-website/deployments>
2. Find the most recent successful deployment
3. Click the **"‚ãØ"** (three dots) menu ‚Üí **"Redeploy"**
4. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** for faster deployment
5. Wait for completion and verify

### Why CLI Doesn't Work

The Vercel CLI reports: `"Git author austin@theporadas.com must have access to the team Austin's projects"`

This happens because:

- Earlier commits were made with `austin@theporadas.com`
- Your Vercel account is `bbasketballer75-9127`
- Vercel enforces team access based on Git commit history

**Solution:** Always use the dashboard for this project. The dashboard bypasses Git author checks and deploys directly from your connected GitHub repository.

### GitHub Actions (Future Setup)

- Automated deployment workflow exists in `.github/workflows/`
- Currently requires Firebase service account setup
- Can enable after manual deployment verification
