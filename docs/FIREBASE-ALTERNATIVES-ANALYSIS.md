# üÜì Free Firebase Alternatives Analysis for Wedding Website

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Context:** Evaluating cost-effective backends for theporadas-wedding-site

---

## üí∞ Firebase Free Tier Limits

### Spark Plan (Free Forever)

- **Firestore Database:**
  - 1 GB storage
  - 50,000 reads/day
  - 20,000 writes/day
  - 20,000 deletes/day

- **Cloud Storage:**
  - 5 GB storage
  - 1 GB/day download bandwidth
  - 50,000 uploads/day
  - 50,000 downloads/day

- **Authentication:**
  - Unlimited (Email/Password, Google, etc.)

- **Hosting:**
  - 10 GB storage
  - 360 MB/day bandwidth

### üö® Potential Issues for Wedding Website

**Scenario: 150 wedding guests**

- Each guest uploads 5 photos (3MB avg) = 2.25 GB **‚Üí EXCEEDS 5GB free tier**
- Each guest views gallery 3x during wedding day = ~2,250 reads/day **‚Üí Within limits**
- Wedding day video views = Could exceed 1GB/day download **‚Üí RISKY**

**Estimated Monthly Cost if Exceeded:**

- Storage overage: $0.026/GB = ~$0.08/month for extra 3GB
- Bandwidth overage: $0.12/GB = Variable based on traffic
- **Total: $5-20/month during active period**

**Verdict:** Firebase free tier *might* work but risky for 100+ guests with photo uploads.

## üéØ OTHER FREE ALTERNATIVES

### Option 2: Appwrite

- SQLite-based (single file)
- Built-in Auth
- Built-in file storage
- Built-in admin UI

**Pros:**

- 100% free (self-hosted)
- Incredibly simple
- Single executable file
- Perfect for small projects

**Cons:**

- Must self-host (need server/VPS)
- SQLite limitations for concurrent writes
- No managed cloud option

**Best for:** If you have a VPS and want simplest possible setup

---

### Option 4: Nhost

**Free Tier:**

- 1 GB database (PostgreSQL)
- 1 GB storage
- Hasura GraphQL included
- Authentication included

**Pros:**

- PostgreSQL like Supabase
- Hasura GraphQL is powerful

---

### Option 5: Stay with Firebase (Optimized)

**If you want to stay with Firebase, optimize:**

1. **Use image compression:**
   - Compress photos to max 500KB (instead of 3MB)
   - 150 guests √ó 5 photos √ó 0.5MB = 375MB **‚Üí Within free tier!**

2. **Lazy load gallery:**
   - Only load thumbnails initially
   - Reduces bandwidth significantly

3. **Set storage lifecycle:**
   - Auto-delete uploads after 6 months
   - Keep costs at $0

4. **Monitor usage:**
   - Set alerts at 80% of free tier
   - Upgrade only if needed ($25/month Blaze plan)

**Optimized Firebase = Could stay free!**

## üèÜ RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR WEDDING

### Best Choice: **Supabase**

**Why:**

1. **Already partially configured** in your project
2. **50% cheaper** than Firebase if you exceed limits
3. **Better free tier** for your use case
4. **PostgreSQL** (you already have MCP integration)
5. **Open source** (not vendor lock-in)
6. **Easy migration** from current setup

### Implementation Plan (30 min)

**Step 1: Create Supabase Project**

```bash
# Visit https://supabase.com/dashboard
# Click "New Project"
# Name: theporadas-wedding
# Region: US East (closest to PA)
# Database password: (save securely)
```

**Step 2: Get Supabase Credentials**

```
Project URL: https://yourproject.supabase.co
Anon Key: (public, safe for client)
Service Role Key: (private, for admin operations)
```

**Step 3: Update Environment Variables**

```env
# Replace Firebase vars with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key  # Server-side only
```

**Step 4: Update Code (Minimal Changes)**

```javascript
// Instead of Firebase:
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)

// Upload photo:
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('wedding-photos')
  .upload(`photos/${filename}`, file)

// Get photos:
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('photos')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

**Step 5: Enable Storage & Auth in Supabase Dashboard**

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Go with Supabase because:**

1. **Cost:** Free for your needs (150 guests, 2GB photos)
2. **Already configured:** PostgreSQL + MCP integration exists
3. **Migration:** 30 minutes of work
4. **Future-proof:** Open source, no vendor lock-in
5. **Features:** Everything Firebase offers + more
6. **Cheaper:** If you need to scale beyond free tier

**Alternative:** Optimize Firebase (compress images) and stay free

**Your call!** Both work, but Supabase is more cost-effective long-term.
