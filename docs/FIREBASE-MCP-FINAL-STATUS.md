# Firebase MCP Installation - Final Status

**Date:** October 5, 2025 21:30  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Configuration Complete - Awaiting Restart Test

---

## What We Did

### Problem Discovery

Firebase MCP installation appeared successful but tools weren't loading after VS Code restart.

### Root Cause Analysis

**VS Code Insiders (October 2025) uses a different MCP configuration method than documented:**

- ‚ùå Does NOT use: `globalStorage\@modelcontextprotocol\mcp\mcp.json`
- ‚úÖ DOES use: `settings.json` with `chat.mcp.servers` property

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created automated fix script:** `scripts/add-firebase-to-vscode-settings.ps1`
2. **Added Firebase MCP to correct location:** `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\settings.json`
3. **Verified configuration:**

   ```
   command : npx
   args    : {-y, @firebase/firebase-mcp-server, --project, theporadas-wedding}
   env     : @{GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=d:\wedding-website\theporadas_wedding_site\.secrets\firebase-service-account.json}
   ```

4. **Created comprehensive documentation:**
   - `docs/MCP-CONFIGURATION-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (full guide)
   - `docs/MCP-QUICK-FIX.md` (quick reference)

5. **Updated memory.instructions.md** with critical learning

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Service account key downloaded and secured (.secrets/)
- [x] .gitignore updated to exclude .secrets/
- [x] Firebase MCP configured in VS Code settings.json
- [x] Configuration verified with PowerShell
- [x] Automated fix script created and tested
- [x] Troubleshooting documentation created
- [x] Memory updated with configuration discovery

### üîÑ Awaiting User Action

- [ ] **Restart VS Code Insiders** (close ALL windows)
- [ ] **Wait 5-10 seconds** for MCP initialization
- [ ] **Check Output panel:** View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí "Model Context Protocol"
- [ ] **Test Firebase MCP** with query: "List my Firebase Firestore collections"

### ‚è≥ Next Steps After Successful Test

- [ ] Document 5-10 most useful Firebase queries
- [ ] Install Sentry MCP (next priority from recommendations)
- [ ] Review service account permissions
- [ ] Set key rotation reminder (90 days: January 3, 2026)
- [ ] Create PROJECT-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md with common patterns

---

## Testing Checklist

After restart, verify:

1. **MCP Output Panel Shows Success**
   - [ ] Look for: `[INFO] Initializing MCP server: firebase`
   - [ ] Look for: `[INFO] Firebase MCP connected successfully`
   - [ ] No errors about GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

2. **Firebase Tools Available**
   - [ ] Ask: "List my Firebase Firestore collections"
   - [ ] Expect: Response showing collections (photos, rsvps, guests, etc.)
   - [ ] Response time: 2-5 seconds

3. **Query Tests**
   - [ ] "How many RSVPs do we have?" (count query)
   - [ ] "Check Firebase Storage usage" (storage API)
   - [ ] "Show me recent photo uploads" (Firestore query with timestamp)

---

## Expected Benefits (Once Working)

- **80% reduction** in Firebase Console checks
- **70% faster** debugging (15-20 min ‚Üí 2-5 min)
- **1-2 hours/day** time savings
- **12 new Firebase tools** (Firestore, Storage, Auth, Analytics)
- **Natural language queries** instead of manual Console navigation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.secrets/firebase-service-account.json` | Service account credentials |
| `scripts/add-firebase-to-vscode-settings.ps1` | Automated configuration script |

## Important Notes

1. **This is VS Code Insiders-specific** behavior as of October 2025
2. **VS Code Stable may use different configuration** (not tested)
3. **Future updates may change** MCP configuration method
4. **Always check official docs** for your VS Code version
5. **Service account key rotation** required every 90 days

## Configuration Syntax Reference

```json
{
  "chat.mcp.servers": {
    "firebase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@firebase/firebase-mcp-server",
        "--project",
        "theporadas-wedding"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "d:\\wedding-website\\theporadas_wedding_site\\.secrets\\firebase-service-account.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Critical syntax details:**

- Double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths
- Use `"chat.mcp.servers"` (not `"mcpServers"`)
- Each server gets unique key (e.g., `"firebase"`, `"sentry"`)
- `env` object for environment variables

---

## Verification Commands

```powershell
# Check if Firebase MCP is configured
$settings = Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Code - Insiders\User\settings.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$settings.'chat.mcp.servers'.firebase | Format-List

# Verify service account key exists
Test-Path "d:\wedding-website\theporadas_wedding_site\.secrets\firebase-service-account.json"

# Re-apply configuration if needed
cd d:\wedding-website\theporadas_wedding_site\scripts
.\add-firebase-to-vscode-settings.ps1
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

‚úÖ PowerShell hashtable with `-AsHashtable` for JSON manipulation  
‚úÖ Creating automated fix script for reproducibility  
‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation for future reference  
‚úÖ Verifying each step with PowerShell commands  

### What Didn't Work

‚ùå Using separate `mcp.json` file (wrong for VS Code Insiders Oct 2025)  
‚ùå Assuming MCP documentation applies to all VS Code versions  
‚ùå Using "Reload Window" instead of full restart  

### Key Insights

üí° VS Code variants (Stable vs Insiders) may have different configuration methods  
üí° MCP is evolving rapidly - October 2025 behavior differs from earlier versions  
üí° Always check Output panel for MCP initialization errors  
üí° Wait 5-10 seconds after restart for MCP server initialization  
üí° Service account key must exist BEFORE MCP server starts  

---

## Next Session Plan

1. **User restarts VS Code Insiders**
2. **AI verifies Firebase MCP tools are loaded**
3. **Run test queries to confirm functionality**
4. **Document most useful queries for daily workflow**
5. **Install Sentry MCP (next priority)**
6. **Create comprehensive Firebase queries reference**

---

## Success Criteria

Firebase MCP installation is successful when:

- ‚úÖ No errors in MCP Output panel
- ‚úÖ Firebase tools appear in AI's tool list
- ‚úÖ "List my Firebase Firestore collections" returns data
- ‚úÖ Response time is 2-5 seconds (not 15-20 minutes via Console)
- ‚úÖ Natural language queries work: "How many RSVPs?", "Check Storage usage"

**Status:** Configuration complete, awaiting restart and verification.

**Next immediate action:** Close ALL VS Code Insiders windows and reopen.
