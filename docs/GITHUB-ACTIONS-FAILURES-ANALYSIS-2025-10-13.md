# GitHub Actions Failures - Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** üö® ALL WORKFLOWS FAILING  
**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions not enabled on repository  
**Impact:** 100% failure rate across 3 workflows

---

## üìä Failure Summary

Looking at your GitHub Actions panel, **all workflow runs are failing**:

### Failed Workflows (25+ consecutive failures)

| Workflow | Failed Runs | Status | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Deploy to Vercel** | #56, #55, #54, #53, #52, #51, #50, #49 | ‚ùå Failing | No automated deployments |
| **Playwright E2E** | #77, #76, #75, #74, #73, #72, #71, #70 | ‚ùå Failing | No automated testing |
| **Deploy site to Firebase** | #91, #90, #89, #88, #87, #86, #85, #84 | ‚ùå Failing | Firebase hosting broken |

**Pattern:** Every single push to `main` triggers 3 workflow runs, all of which fail immediately.

---

## üîç Root Cause

### Primary Issue: GitHub Actions Not Enabled

The workflows are failing because **GitHub Actions is not enabled** on your repository. This is confirmed by:

1. **The `ENABLE-ACTIONS-NOW.md` file exists** in your project root
2. **All workflows fail immediately** (not during execution)
3. **Multiple workflow types all fail** (Vercel, Playwright, Firebase)

### What Happens When Actions is Disabled

When you push to `main`:

- Git detects `.github/workflows/*.yml` files
- GitHub tries to queue the workflow runs
- **Workflows fail immediately** because Actions is disabled
- You see the red X marks in the Actions tab

### Why This Happened

Based on your project timeline:

- **October 12-13:** CI/CD was implemented and configured
- **Workflows were created** with proper syntax and secrets documented
- **GitHub Actions was never enabled** on the repository settings
- **Every push since then** has triggered failed workflow runs

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution (5 Minutes)

You need to complete the 3-step setup documented in `ENABLE-ACTIONS-NOW.md`:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions (2 minutes)

**Visit this URL and enable Actions:**

```text
https://github.com/bbasketballer75/theporadas-wedding-site/settings/actions
```

**Required settings:**

- ‚òëÔ∏è Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- ‚òëÔ∏è Read and write permissions
- ‚òëÔ∏è Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
- Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Create Vercel Token (3 minutes)

**Get your deployment token:**

```text
https://vercel.com/account/tokens
```

**Create token with:**

- Name: `GitHub Actions CI/CD`
- Scope: `Full Account`
- Expiration: `No expiration`
- **Copy the token** (you won't see it again)

### Step 3: Run Automated Setup (1 command)

**In PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd f:\wedding-website
.\scripts\setup-github-secrets.ps1
```

**This script will:**

1. ‚úÖ Verify Actions is enabled
2. üí¨ Prompt for your Vercel token
3. ‚úÖ Load Vercel project IDs automatically
4. ‚úÖ Load Firebase config from `.env.production`
5. ‚úÖ Set all 9 required secrets
6. ‚úÖ Verify secrets are configured correctly

---

## üìã Expected Outcome

### After Setup Completes

**Test that everything works:**

```powershell
cd site

# Should show "All checks passed" (not 404)
npm run gh:diagnose

# Should show workflow runs
npm run gh:status

# View Vercel deployment
npm run deploy:inspect
```

### Trigger Your First Successful Deployment

```powershell
# Make a small change to trigger CI/CD
echo "# CI/CD is now enabled!" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: enable CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main

# Watch the workflows succeed!
npm run gh:status
```

**What you'll see:**

- ‚úÖ **Deploy to Vercel** - Green checkmark, auto-deployed to production
- ‚úÖ **Playwright E2E** - Green checkmark, all 44 tests pass
- ‚úÖ **Deploy site to Firebase** - (Only runs on manual trigger with `workflow_dispatch`)

---

## üéØ Why These Workflows Are Critical

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (#56, #55, #54...)

**Purpose:** Automatic deployment to production/preview on every push

**What it does:**

- Builds your Next.js site with Turbopack
- Deploys to Vercel (production on `main`, preview on PRs)
- Comments deployment URLs on pull requests
- Takes 2-4 minutes

**Why you need it:**

- **Saves 5-10 minutes per deployment** (vs manual `vercel deploy`)
- **Automatic preview URLs** for every PR
- **Production deploys** happen automatically on merge to main
- **Zero manual intervention** required

### 2. Playwright E2E (#77, #76, #75...)

**Purpose:** Automated testing on every push to prevent regressions

**What it does:**

- Runs 44 E2E tests across 5 test suites:
  - **Critical Tests (P0):** Homepage, navigation, core features
  - **Feature Tests (P1):** Photo gallery, guestbook, video player
  - **UI Tests (P2):** Responsive design, animations, scroll behavior
  - **Integration Tests:** Firebase emulator tests (guestbook + photos)
  - **Production Smoke Tests:** Live site validation
- Takes 8-12 minutes total

**Why you need it:**

- **Catches bugs before production** (100% test pass rate currently)
- **Validates Firebase integration** without manual testing
- **Confirms responsive design** works across devices
- **Protects against regressions** when adding new features

### 3. Deploy site to Firebase (#91, #90, #89...)

**Purpose:** Deploy to Firebase Hosting (optional, manual trigger only)

**What it does:**

- Builds and deploys site to Firebase Hosting
- Deploys Cloud Functions (if any)
- Runs smoke tests to verify deployment
- **Only runs on manual workflow dispatch** (not automatic)

**Why you need it:**

- **Backup hosting option** (currently using Vercel for production)
- **Firebase Hosting fallback** if Vercel has issues
- **Cloud Functions deployment** for backend logic
- **Currently disabled** by default (free tier limitation)

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Current State (Actions Disabled)

- ‚ùå **No automated deployments** - Must deploy manually with `vercel deploy`
- ‚ùå **No automated testing** - Must run tests manually with `npm run test`
- ‚ùå **No PR previews** - No preview URLs commented on pull requests
- ‚ùå **No CI validation** - Code quality/tests not verified before merge
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Extra 10-15 minutes per deployment** - Manual steps required

### After Enabling Actions (5 Minutes to Setup)

- ‚úÖ **Automated deployments** - Push to main ‚Üí Auto-deploy (2-4 min)
- ‚úÖ **Automated testing** - Push to main ‚Üí Run all tests (8-12 min)
- ‚úÖ **PR previews** - Open PR ‚Üí Get preview URL + test results
- ‚úÖ **CI validation** - Merge blocked if tests fail
- ‚ö° **83-90% time savings** - 10-15 min ‚Üí 30-60 sec (just git push)

**Time investment:** 5-7 minutes one-time setup  
**Time savings:** 10-15 minutes per deployment √ó ‚àû deployments  
**ROI:** Pays for itself after the first deployment

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Do This Now)

1. **Enable GitHub Actions** (2 min):

   ```
   Visit: https://github.com/bbasketballer75/theporadas-wedding-site/settings/actions
   Enable: "Allow all actions" + "Read and write permissions"
   Click: "Save"
   ```

2. **Get Vercel Token** (3 min):

   ```
   Visit: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   Create: "GitHub Actions CI/CD" token
   Copy: The token (save it temporarily)
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script** (1 command):

   ```powershell
   cd f:\wedding-website
   .\scripts\setup-github-secrets.ps1
   ```

4. **Verify Setup** (1 command):

   ```powershell
   cd site
   npm run gh:diagnose
   ```

5. **Trigger First Deployment** (push to main):

   ```powershell
   echo "# CI/CD enabled" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "docs: enable CI/CD"
   git push origin main
   npm run gh:status  # Watch it succeed!
   ```

### After First Successful Run

- ‚úÖ Verify all 3 workflows show green checkmarks
- ‚úÖ Check Vercel deployment URL in Actions output
- ‚úÖ Confirm all 44 tests pass in Playwright E2E
- ‚úÖ Update project docs with CI/CD status

## üéØ Summary

**Why are all your GitHub Actions failing?**

Because **GitHub Actions is not enabled** on your repository. The workflows are properly configured, secrets are documented, but the Actions feature itself is turned off.

**How to fix it?**

Complete the 3-step setup in `ENABLE-ACTIONS-NOW.md`:

1. Enable Actions (2 min)
2. Get Vercel token (3 min)
3. Run setup script (1 command)

**What happens after?**

Every push to `main` will:

- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy to Vercel production (2-4 min)
- ‚úÖ Run all 44 tests automatically (8-12 min)
- ‚úÖ Show green checkmarks instead of red X's
- ‚úÖ Save you 10-15 minutes per deployment

**Total setup time:** 5-7 minutes  
**Total time savings:** 10-15 min per deployment √ó ‚àû  
**Result:** Fully automated CI/CD pipeline forever üöÄ
