   - Or use Vimeo: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/YOUR_VIDEO_ID`

2. **Add family photos** to `/public/images/family/` directory:
   - `jordyn.jpg` (bride photo)
   - `austin.jpg` (groom photo)
   - `bride-mom.jpg`, `bride-dad.jpg` (bride's parents)
   - `groom-mom.jpg`, `groom-dad.jpg` (groom's parents)
   - `bridesmaid-1.jpg` through `bridesmaid-3.jpg`
   - `groomsman-1.jpg` through `groomsman-3.jpg`
   - `placeholder-person.jpg` (fallback image)

3. **Update family member names** in `FamilyTreeSection.jsx`
   - Lines 28-55: Replace placeholder names with actual names

### Optional (Cleanup)

1. **Delete unused redirect pages** (if desired):
   - `site/pages/our-story.js`
   - `site/pages/timeline.js`
   - `site/pages/venue.js`
   - `site/pages/photobooth.js`
   - `site/pages/album.js`

   - `site/components/sections/VenueSection.jsx`

## Site Structure

### Final Section Order

1. **Hero** (`#hero`) - Short welcome & introduction
2. **Gallery** (`#gallery`) - Engagement photos showcase
3. **Family Tree** (`#family-tree`) - Wedding party & family structure
4. **Video** (`#video`) - Main wedding video player
5. **Upload** (`#upload`) - Guest photo sharing
6. **Guest Book** (`#guestbook`) - Messages & well wishes
