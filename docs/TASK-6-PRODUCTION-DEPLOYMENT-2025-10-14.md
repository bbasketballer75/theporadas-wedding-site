## üìù Known Issues & Considerations

### Test Environment Only

**1 Flaky Test (Acceptable):**
- **Test:** Concurrent uploads performance
- **Issue:** First run finds 510 docs instead of 10 (race condition)
- **Status:** Passes on retry consistently
- **Impact:** Emulator-only, not production issue
- **Fix priority:** Low (doesn't affect production)

**2 Timing-Sensitive Tests (Phase 15):**
- **Tests:** Real-time listener updates
- **Issue:** Parallel execution with 2 workers causes timing issues
- **Workaround:** Sequential execution OR longer wait times
- **Impact:** Dev/testing only, not production
- **Fix priority:** Medium (improves dev experience)

### Production (None Identified)

No known production issues at this time. All critical functionality working as expected.
