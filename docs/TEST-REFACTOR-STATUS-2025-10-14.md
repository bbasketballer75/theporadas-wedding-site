# Test Refactor Status Report - October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** Infrastructure improvements complete, but test execution blocked by dev overlay dialogs and test environment issues.

**Progress:** 3/10 tasks completed (30%)

- ✅ Playwright config split (dev/production)
- ✅ Error filtering system created
- ✅ Firestore permissions fixed
- ⏳ Test integration pending

**Pass Rate:** 2/28 critical tests passing (7%)
**Root Cause:** Next.js dev overlay dialogs blocking test interactions + test timeout issues

---

## Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Playwright Configuration Split ✅

**File:** `site/playwright.config.js`

**Changes:**

- Rewrote from 40 lines → 140+ lines
- Created 6 test projects (was 2):
  - `critical-dev` - Development environment, lenient thresholds
  - `critical-prod` - Production environment, strict validation
  - `features` - Feature tests with retries
  - `ui` - UI component tests
  - `production` - Production smoke tests
  - `mobile` - Responsive design tests

**Benefits:**

- Environment-specific configuration
- Dynamic timeouts based on environment
- Conditional webServer for development only
- Comprehensive inline documentation

### 2. Intelligent Error Filtering System ✅

**File:** `site/tests/helpers/error-filters.js` (300+ lines)

**Components:**

- `filterCriticalErrors()` - Main filtering function
- `categorizeErrors()` - Organize errors by type
- `createErrorReport()` - Generate debug reports
- Pattern arrays:
  - `EXPECTED_DEV_PATTERNS` - Development-only warnings (12+ patterns)
  - `FIRESTORE_EXPECTED_PATTERNS` - Expected Firebase warnings (6+ patterns)
  - `ALWAYS_CRITICAL_PATTERNS` - Never filter these (10+ patterns)
  - `ACCEPTABLE_CSP_PATTERNS` - Known CSP violations (8+ patterns)

**Integration Status:**

- ✅ Imported into `console-monitoring.spec.js`
- ✅ Imported into `csp-validation.spec.js`
- ✅ Imported into `smoke-tests.spec.js`
- ✅ Tests show "Collected X total errors (0 critical)" messages
- ⚠️ Tests still failing due to other issues

**Evidence of Working:**

```
✅ Collected 2 total errors (0 critical):
✅ NO critical console errors on homepage (2 total, 2 filtered)
✅ NO critical CSP violations on homepage (4 total, 4 acceptable)
```

### 3. Firestore Security Rules Fixed ✅

**File:** `firestore.rules`

**Problem:** Guestbook collection had no security rules, causing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive guestbook rules:

```javascript
match /guestbook/{messageId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if 
    // Validate required fields exist
    request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['name', 'message', 'createdAt']) &&
    // Validate field lengths (prevent spam)
    request.resource.data.name.size() > 0 && request.resource.data.name.size() <= 100 &&
    request.resource.data.message.size() > 0 && request.resource.data.message.size() <= 1000;
  allow delete: if true; // For moderation
}
```

**Deployment:** ✅ Successfully deployed to Firebase

```
+  firestore: rules file firestore.rules compiled successfully
+  firestore: released rules firestore.rules to cloud.firestore
```

### 4. Dev Overlay Dismissal Helper Created ✅

**File:** `site/tests/helpers/dismiss-dev-overlay.js`

**Functions:**

- `dismissDevOverlay()` - Dismisses Next.js dev overlay dialogs
- `dismissFirebasePermissionDialog()` - Dismisses specific Firebase error dialogs
- `dismissAllDevOverlays()` - Comprehensive cleanup
- `gotoWithoutOverlays()` - Navigate and dismiss in one call

**Methods Used:**

1. Click close button
2. Press Escape key
3. Click outside dialog (backdrop)
4. JavaScript removal (last resort)

**Status:** ⚠️ Created but not yet integrated into tests

---

## Current Blockers

### Blocker #1: Dev Overlay Dialogs

**Severity:** CRITICAL (blocking 26+ tests)

**Description:** Next.js development overlay dialogs appear over page content, preventing test interactions.

**Evidence:**

```
dialog "Runtime FirebaseError" [ref=e101]:
  paragraph: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Impact:**

- Tests cannot click buttons (dialog covers them)
- Tests timeout waiting for elements
- Even with Firestore rules fixed, old cached error dialogs block tests

**Solution:** Integrate `dismissAllDevOverlays()` helper into test beforeEach hooks

**Files Needing Updates:**

- `tests/e2e/critical/console-monitoring.spec.js` (8 tests)
- `tests/e2e/critical/csp-validation.spec.js` (6 tests)
- `tests/e2e/critical/firebase.spec.js` (3 tests)
- `tests/e2e/critical/firestore.spec.js` (5 tests)
- `tests/e2e/critical/guestbook-realtime.spec.js` (4 tests)

### Blocker #2: Test Timeouts

**Severity:** HIGH

**Description:** Tests timing out after 60 seconds, even with retries.

**Evidence:**

```
Error: page.waitForLoadState: Test timeout of 60000ms exceeded.
```

**Contributing Factors:**

1. Dev overlays delaying page load
2. Firestore connection delays
3. Next.js Turbopack compilation time
4. Test waiting for elements covered by dialogs

**Solution:**

1. Increase timeout for development environment (already done in config)
2. Dismiss dev overlays immediately (helper created)
3. Use `gotoWithoutOverlays()` instead of plain `page.goto()`

---

## Test Results Analysis

### Current Pass/Fail Breakdown

**Total Critical Tests:** 28
**Passing:** 2 (7%)
**Failing:** 26 (93%)

### Failed Test Categories

| Category | Tests | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Console Monitoring | 8 | Dev overlay blocking + timeouts |
| CSP Validation | 6 | Dev overlay blocking + timeouts |
| Firebase Init | 3 | Dev overlay blocking |
| Firestore Connectivity | 5 | Dev overlay blocking + timeouts |
| Guestbook Realtime | 4 | Dev overlay blocking + timeouts |

### Passing Tests

1. ✅ CSP meta tag exists in document
2. ✅ (Second test unknown - need full report)

**Why These Pass:**

- Don't require page interactions (just check meta tag exists)
- Complete before dev overlay appears
- Simple assertions that succeed quickly

---

## Package.json Test Scripts Updated

**File:** `site/package.json`

**Old Scripts:**

```json
"test:critical": "playwright test site/tests/e2e/critical --project=chromium"
"test:features": "playwright test site/tests/e2e/features ... --project=chromium"
"test:all": "playwright test --project=chromium"
```

**New Scripts:**

```json
"test:critical": "playwright test --project=critical-dev"
"test:critical:prod": "BASE_URL=https://wedding-website-sepia-ten.vercel.app playwright test --project=critical-prod"
"test:features": "playwright test --project=features"
"test:ui": "playwright test --project=ui"
"test:mobile": "playwright test --project=mobile"
"test:production": "BASE_URL=https://wedding-website-sepia-ten.vercel.app playwright test --project=production"
"test:all": "playwright test --project=critical-dev --project=features --project=ui"
"test:all:prod": "BASE_URL=https://wedding-website-sepia-ten.vercel.app playwright test --project=critical-prod --project=production"
"test:report": "playwright show-report"
```

**Benefits:**

- Use new project names (critical-dev, etc.)
- Separate dev/production test runs
- Added test:report script
- Environment variable support

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (15 minutes)

**Task:** Integrate dev overlay dismissal into critical tests

**Action:**

1. Update `console-monitoring.spec.js`:

   ```javascript
   const { dismissAllDevOverlays } = require('../../helpers/dismiss-dev-overlay');
   
   test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
       // Reset error collections
       globalErrors = [];
       globalWarnings = [];
       
       // Dismiss dev overlays before monitoring starts
       page.on('load', async () => {
           await dismissAllDevOverlays(page);
       });
   });
   ```

2. Update other critical test files similarly

**Expected Impact:** 20+ tests should start passing

### SHORT-TERM (30 minutes)

**Task:** Replace `page.goto()` with `gotoWithoutOverlays()` in all critical tests

**Benefits:**

- Single call handles navigation + overlay dismissal
- Consistent pattern across all tests
- Reduces test flakiness

**Example:**

```javascript
const { gotoWithoutOverlays } = require('../../helpers/dismiss-dev-overlay');

test('Homepage has NO critical console errors', async ({ page }) => {
    await gotoWithoutOverlays(page, '/'); // Instead of page.goto('/')
    await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
    
    const criticalErrors = filterCriticalErrors(globalErrors.map((e) => e.text));
    expect(criticalErrors).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

### MEDIUM-TERM (1 hour)

**Tasks:**

1. Fix flaky guestbook tests (Task #4)
2. Fix photo-upload selectors (Task #5)
3. Run full test suite validation

**Expected Results:**

- Critical tests: 24/28 passing (86%)
- Feature tests: ~30/40 passing (75%)
- Total: ~54/68 passing (79%)

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why Error Filtering Works But Tests Still Fail

**Observation:** Tests show "0 critical errors" but still fail.

**Explanation:**

1. **Error filtering executes correctly:**
   - `filterCriticalErrors()` successfully identifies expected warnings
   - Console output shows filtered counts: `(2 total, 2 filtered)`
   - This proves the logic is sound

2. **But tests fail BEFORE reaching assertions:**
   - Dev overlay dialog appears over page
   - Test tries to interact with button covered by dialog
   - Test times out waiting for clickable button
   - Test fails with timeout error (not assertion error)

3. **Evidence:**

   ```
   Error: page.waitForLoadState: Test timeout of 60000ms exceeded.
   ```

   This is a TIMEOUT error, not an assertion failure. The test never reaches the `expect(criticalErrors).toHaveLength(0)` line because it times out earlier.

### Next.js Dev Overlay Behavior

**When Overlay Appears:**

- On any unhandled exception
- On Firebase connection errors
- On CSP violations
- On network request failures

**Why It's Blocking Tests:**

1. Overlay is rendered in a `<nextjs-portal>` element
2. Portal has high z-index, covers entire page
3. Dialog is modal, prevents clicks outside
4. Dialog doesn't auto-dismiss on subsequent navigations

**Why Firestore Rules Fix Alone Doesn't Help:**

- Rules are now correct (deployed successfully)
- But cached error overlay persists in browser
- New page loads don't clear old overlays
- Need explicit dismissal code

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Progress

**Option A: Quick Win (30 minutes)**

- Integrate `dismissAllDevOverlays()` into beforeEach hooks
- Replace `page.goto()` with `gotoWithoutOverlays()`
- Run tests again
- Expected: 20+ tests passing immediately

**Option B: Full Integration (2 hours)**

- Complete Option A
- Fix remaining flaky tests (guestbook, photo-upload)
- Create 4 new test suites for missing pages
- Achieve 90%+ pass rate

### For Long-Term Stability

1. **Production Testing Priority:**
   - Focus on production environment tests (no dev overlays)
   - Use `npm run test:critical:prod` against live site
   - More reliable, reflects actual user experience

2. **Development Testing Strategy:**
   - Always dismiss overlays in beforeEach
   - Use longer timeouts (already configured)
   - Accept some flakiness in dev environment
   - Rely on production tests for final validation

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Run production tests against deployed preview URLs
   - Skip dev environment tests in CI
   - Faster, more reliable automated testing
