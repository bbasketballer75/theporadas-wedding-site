# VS Code Tool Limit Solution - October 4, 2025

## Problem Solved ✅

**Error:** "Tool limit exceeded (143/128)"

**Root Cause:** VS Code Copilot has a hard limit of 128 tools per chat session. With 10 MCP servers active, we had 143 tools loaded, exceeding the limit by 15.

**Solution:** Optimized MCP configuration to load only essential servers by default, keeping ~80-100 tools active (well under limit).

---

## New Configuration (6 Active Servers)

### Always Active

1. ✅ **sequentialthinking** - Deep reasoning capabilities
2. ✅ **filesystem** - Project file operations (14 tools)
3. ✅ **postgres** - Database access (1-2 tools)
4. ✅ **brave** - Web search (2-3 tools; remember `BRAVE_API_KEY` = `X-Subscription-Token` and run `scripts/check-brave-throttle.ps1` before manual calls)
5. ✅ **context7** - Documentation lookup (HTTP)
6. ✅ **github** - Repository operations (HTTP)

**Total: ~80-100 tools (under 128 limit)**

### Available On-Demand (Activate When Needed)

1. 🔄 **puppeteer** - Browser automation (7 tools)
   - Activate: `activate_puppeteer_tools()`

2. 🔄 **playwright** - E2E testing (varies)
   - Activate when running tests

3. 🔄 **chromedevtools** - Browser debugging (20+ tools)
   - Activate: `activate_chromedevt_browser_navigation_tools()`

---

## How On-Demand Activation Works

### Example: Need Browser Automation

**Before:**

- All 143 tools loaded
- Hit tool limit error
- Can't use any tools

**After:**

1. You say: "I need to scrape this website"
2. I call: `activate_puppeteer_tools()`
3. Puppeteer tools become available (7 tools added)
4. Total still under 128
5. I use puppeteer to complete task
6. Tools remain active for rest of session

### Benefits

- ✅ Never hit the 128 tool limit
- ✅ All capabilities still available
- ✅ Activate tools only when needed
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ No restrictions on usage

---

## Important Clarifications

### ❌ WRONG Understanding

"I should minimize how many times I call tools"

- This would restrict AI capabilities
- Not the actual problem

### ✅ CORRECT Understanding

"I should manage which tool CATEGORIES are loaded"

- Activate tools as needed during work
- Call tools as many times as necessary
- Use full capabilities without restriction
- Smart loading, maximum usage

---

## Your Instructions: Use Everything to Max Capacity

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1. ✅ Call tools as many times as needed (no limit on usage)
2. ✅ Use ALL features of every activated tool
3. ✅ Maximize capabilities (don't hold back)
4. ✅ Activate additional tools when needed
5. ✅ Parallel calls for efficiency (still good practice)
6. ✅ Batch operations when it makes sense (efficiency, not restriction)

**Key Point:** The optimization is about LOADING tools smartly, not USING them sparingly.

---

## Next Steps

1. **✅ COMPLETE** - MCP configuration optimized
2. **✅ COMPLETE** - Tool count reduced to ~80-100
3. **ACTION REQUIRED** - Restart VS Code Insiders
4. **READY** - No more tool limit errors
5. **READY** - Full capabilities available on-demand

---

## Testing After Restart

Expected behavior:

- ✅ Chat starts without tool limit error
- ✅ ~80-100 tools loaded initially
- ✅ Can activate puppeteer/playwright/chromedevtools as needed
- ✅ Total tools stay under 128
- ✅ Full functionality maintained

If you still see errors after restart:

1. Check mcp.json has only 6 servers active
2. Verify VS Code restarted completely
3. Check Output → GitHub Copilot → MCP logs

## Agent Todo Workflow (October 9, 2025)

- Enabled the Copilot todo widget (`chat.todoListTool.enabled`) so the agent always sees the active optimization plan while monitoring tool usage.
- Widget is pinned inside the Chat panel (`chat.todoListWidget.position = "panel"`) to keep it visible when toggling MCP servers on or off.
- Link each todo entry to the tracker in `docs/OPTIMIZATION-CHECKLIST-2025-10-09.md` before activating optional servers like Playwright or Puppeteer.
- Safety rails stay on: `chat.tools.edits.autoApprove` remains `false` so todo-driven edits never auto-touch paths such as `.env` or `.secrets/`.

## Backup Information

**Configuration backup created:**
`C:\Users\Austin\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User\mcp.json.backup-optimize-20251004181602`

**To restore previous config (if needed):**

```powershell
Copy-Item "$env:APPDATA\Code - Insiders\User\mcp.json.backup-optimize-20251004181602" "$env:APPDATA\Code - Insiders\User\mcp.json" -Force
```

---

## Summary

**Problem:** 143 tools > 128 limit = Error  
**Solution:** 6 servers active (80-100 tools) + 3 on-demand  
**Result:** Under limit + full capabilities  
**Usage:** Use everything to maximum capacity  

**Status: READY FOR NEXT SESSION** 🚀
