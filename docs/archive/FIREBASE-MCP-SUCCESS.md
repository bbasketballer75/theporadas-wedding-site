2. Reopen VS Code Insiders
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for MCP servers to initialize

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After restarting, test with these queries:

#### Test 1: List Collections

```plaintext
List my Firebase Firestore collections
```

**Expected Response:**

```plaintext
Found X Firestore collections:
1. photos (X documents)
2. rsvps (X documents)
3. guests (X documents)
...
```

#### Test 2: Query Data

```plaintext
How many RSVPs do we have?
```

**Expected Response:**

```plaintext
Found X RSVPs in the database
- Attending: X guests
- Declined: X guests
...
```

#### Test 3: Storage Check

```plaintext
Check Firebase Storage usage
```

**Expected Response:**

```plaintext
Firebase Storage statistics:
- Total size: X MB
- Total files: X
...
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If MCP Server Doesn't Load

1. **Check VS Code Output:**
   - View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí Select "Model Context Protocol"
   - Look for Firebase initialization messages

2. **Verify Configuration:**

   ```powershell
   Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Code - Insiders\User\globalStorage\@modelcontextprotocol\mcp\mcp.json"
   ```

3. **Test Firebase CLI Access:**

   ```powershell
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "d:\wedding-website\theporadas_wedding_site\.secrets\firebase-service-account.json"
   firebase projects:list
   ```

4. **Check Service Account Permissions:**
   - Open [IAM & Admin Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
   - Verify service account has at least "Firebase Viewer" role

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors:**

- Service account needs "Firebase Viewer" or "Firebase Admin" role
- Update permissions in Google Cloud Console

**"Project not found" errors:**

- Verify project ID is correct: `theporadas-wedding`
- Check you have access to the project

**"MCP server not responding" errors:**

- Restart VS Code Insiders
- Check if npm can access Firebase MCP: `npx -y @firebase/firebase-mcp-server --help`
