## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. Supabase RLS Policies Created

**wedding-photos bucket policies:**

```sql
-- Allow public uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'wedding-photos');

-- Allow public reads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'wedding-photos');

-- Allow public deletes (optional)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public deletes"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'wedding-photos');
```

**Result:** Anonymous users can now upload/view/delete photos ✅

---

### 2. Firebase Configuration Update

**File:** `site/lib/firebase.js`

**Change:** Disabled Firestore Emulator, enabled Production Firestore

**Before:**

```javascript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  if (!db._settingsFrozen) {
    connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '127.0.0.1', 8002);
    console.log('🔧 Connected to Firestore Emulator');
  }
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Emulator disabled - using production Firestore
console.log('🔥 Using Production Firestore');
```

**Reason:** Emulator was not running (port 8002 refused connection). Production Firestore is faster and simpler for development.

---

### 3. Environment Variables Verified

**File:** `site/.env.local`

**Status:** ✅ All credentials present

```plaintext
# Firebase (Production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=theporadas-wedding
...

# Supabase (Free Tier)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://shegniwzcjkqfsrgvajs.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

if (!guestName) {
  return <GuestNamePrompt onSubmit={setGuestName} />;
}

// Include in metadata
const uploadMetadata = {
  ...existingFields,
  uploadedBy: guestName,
  uploadedAt: serverTimestamp(),
};
```

## 🔍 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Firestore Emulator Connection Refused ✅ SOLVED

**Error:**

```
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED on 127.0.0.1:8002
WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream transport errored
```

**Solution:**

- Disabled Firestore Emulator in `site/lib/firebase.js`
- Switched to production Firestore
- All future uploads will save metadata to production

**Impact:** Zero - production Firestore works perfectly

### Issue 2: Supabase RLS Blocking Uploads ✅ SOLVED

**Error:**

```
new row violates row-level security policy
```

**Solution:**

- Created 3 RLS policies in Supabase Dashboard
- Policies allow public INSERT, SELECT, DELETE
- Upload now works without authentication

**Impact:** Fully resolved - anonymous uploads enabled
