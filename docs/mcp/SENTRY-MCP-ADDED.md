## 🎯 What Sentry MCP Provides

### Production Monitoring

- **Real-time error tracking** - Get alerts when production errors occur
- **Performance monitoring** - Track slow queries, API calls, page loads
- **Session replay** - See exactly what users did before errors
- **Error context** - Stack traces, user info, environment details

### AI Integration Benefits

- Ask: "Show me today's errors in production"
- Ask: "What's the most common error this week?"
- Ask: "Check performance of the RSVP submission endpoint"
- Ask: "Show me errors from user X's session"

### Use Cases for Your Wedding Website

1. **RSVP Issues:** Track failed submissions, validation errors
2. **Photo Upload Problems:** Monitor upload failures, size errors
3. **Performance:** Slow page loads, API timeouts
4. **User Experience:** See what users experienced before errors

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Restart VS Code (Required)

- Close ALL VS Code windows
- Reopen to load Sentry MCP
- Total servers will go from 12 → 13

### 2. Integrate Sentry SDK in Next.js (Optional but Recommended)

**Install Sentry SDK:**

```bash
cd site
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

**Configure with your DSN:**

```javascript
// sentry.client.config.js and sentry.server.config.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://748254274561a7462b62a885dafaea91@o4509754165755904.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509754372653056",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### 3. Test Sentry MCP (After Restart)

**Queries to try:**

```
"Show me recent errors in Sentry"
"What's the error rate today?"
"List all unresolved issues"
"Show me performance metrics"
```
