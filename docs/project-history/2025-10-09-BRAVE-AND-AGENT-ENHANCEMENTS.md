**Focus:** Brave Search MCP reliability + VS Code agent/todo configuration

## Highlights

- Verified `scripts/check-brave-throttle.ps1` with default `-Test` execution for every manual run.
- Refined `scripts/set-mcp-auth.ps1` and `scripts/start-mcp-servers.ps1` with subscription-token reminders and helper references.
- Updated cross-project documentation (MCP quick fixes, verification logs, tool limit guides) to align on Brave API guidance.
- Expanded `.vscode/settings.json` with agent-first defaults: checkpoints, auto-start MCP servers, protected terminal allowlist, and todo widget enablement.
- Documented the agent/todo stack in `docs/AI-CAPABILITIES-GUIDE.md` and introduced `docs/OPTIMIZATION-CHECKLIST-2025-10-09.md` to track the 25-task sweep.

## Next Steps

- Continue occasional Brave throttle self-checks to ensure API behavior remains stable.
- Revisit the todo workflow note during the next optimization cycle to keep the guidance current.
