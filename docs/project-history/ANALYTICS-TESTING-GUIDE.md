sessionStorage.setItem('firebase_debug_mode', true);
location.reload();

// More detailed logs should appear
```

**Check 4: Check Network Tab**

3. Perform an action (upload photo, click nav)
4. Look for requests to: google-analytics.com/g/collect
5. Status should be 200 OK
```

### Events in Console But Not DebugView

**Common Causes:**

1. **Wrong Project Open**

2. **DebugView Not Refreshing**
   - Refresh the DebugView page
   - Close and reopen DebugView

3. **Ad Blocker Enabled**
   - Disable ad blocker (can block analytics)
   - Try incognito/private window

4. **VPN or Privacy Extensions**
   - Some privacy tools block analytics
   - Temporarily disable and test

---

### Browser Console Shows Errors

**Error: "Analytics not available"**

```
Solution: Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
This ensures latest build is loaded
```

**Error: "measurementId is required"**

```
Solution: Check .env.local has NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
Run: npm run build
Deploy: firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Error: "initializeApp failed"**

```
Solution: Check all Firebase config values in .env.local
Ensure no typos or missing values
```
