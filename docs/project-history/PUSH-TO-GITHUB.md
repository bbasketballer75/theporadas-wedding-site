## 📝 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name:** `theporadas_wedding_site`
3. **Description:** `Modern Next.js wedding website with Firebase`
4. **Visibility:**
   - ✅ **Private** (recommended for wedding site)
   - or Public (if you want to share)
5. **Important:** Do NOT check these boxes:
   - ❌ Add README
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
   - (We already have all of these!)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (Advanced)

```powershell
# If you have GitHub CLI installed
gh repo create theporadas_wedding_site --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Add Remote and Push

Once your GitHub repository is created, run these commands:

```powershell
# Add GitHub remote (replace URL with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/bbasketballer75/theporadas_wedding_site.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Expected output:**

```

Counting objects: 100% (136/136), done.
Delta compression using up to X threads
Compressing objects: 100% (120/120), done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

## 🔧 Optional: Configure Repository Settings

### Enable GitHub Pages (if desired)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: Select `main` and `/site` folder
4. Save

### Set Up Secrets for Firebase

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add these secrets:
   - `FIREBASE_TOKEN` (from `firebase login:ci`)
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - Any other environment variables

### Enable Actions (CI/CD)

Your workflows in `.github/workflows/` will automatically run on push!

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy to Firebase

Once pushed to GitHub, deploy your wedding website:

```powershell
# Build the site
npm run build

# Deploy everything
npm run deploy

# Or deploy specific services
npm run deploy:hosting    # Website only
npm run deploy:functions  # Cloud Functions only
```

**Firebase URL:** Your site will be live at:
`https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app`
