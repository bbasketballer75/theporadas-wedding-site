### Files Created (11 new components, 1,089 lines)

1. **SectionTransition.jsx** - Scroll-triggered animations (52 lines)
2. **HeroSection.jsx** - Landing hero with scroll buttons (70 lines)
3. **OurStorySection.jsx** - Love story timeline with 6 milestones (217 lines)
4. **TimelineSection.jsx** - Wedding day events with Firebase (198 lines)
5. **GallerySection.jsx** - Photos/videos with filters + lightbox (127 lines)

## ✅ TESTING CHECKLIST

### 1. SCROLL-SPY NAVIGATION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What to Test:**

- Open <http://localhost:3000> in browser
- Scroll down through all 10 sections slowly
- Watch the navigation bar at the top

**Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Navigation link for current section should be **bold** with **full underline**
- ✅ Other links should be normal weight with no underline (shows underline on hover)
- ✅ Active section should update as you scroll past the middle of each section
- ✅ Transitions should be smooth (no flickering)

**Section Order:**

1. Home → 2. Our Story → 3. Timeline → 4. Gallery → 5. Venue → 6. Photo Booth → 7. Guest Book → 8. Album → 9. Upload → 10. Map

**How to Verify:**

```text
Scroll to Timeline section (middle of viewport)
→ Check: "Timeline" link in nav should be bold + underlined
→ Check: Other links should be normal weight

Scroll to Gallery section
→ Check: "Gallery" link becomes bold + underlined
→ Check: "Timeline" link returns to normal
```text

### 2. SECTION ANIMATIONS (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What to Test:**

- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Scroll down slowly through each section

- ✅ Each section should slide up (y position 30px→0px) during animation
- ✅ Animation duration: 0.5 seconds with ease-out timing
- ✅ Animation should trigger ONCE per section (not repeat)

**Sections to Test:**

- Hero (should already be visible, no animation)
- Our Story (scroll down, should animate in)
- Timeline (continue scrolling, should animate in)
- Gallery, Venue, Photo Booth, Guest Book, Album, Upload, Map (all should animate)

**How to Verify:**

```

Scroll slowly until "Our Story" section is 20% visible
→ Check: Section should smoothly fade in + slide up

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Navigation doesn't highlight active section

**Possible Causes:**

1. Section IDs don't match navigation hrefs
2. IntersectionObserver not triggering

**How to Fix:**

```

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: document.querySelectorAll('[id]')
4. Verify: All sections have correct IDs (hero, our-story, timeline, etc.)
5. Check: No console errors about IntersectionObserver

```

### Issue: Smooth scroll not working

**Possible Causes:**

1. Browser doesn't support smooth scroll
2. CSS override disabling smooth behavior

**How to Fix:**

```

1. Open browser DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: document.documentElement.scrollBehavior
4. Should return: "smooth"
5. If not, check for CSS overrides in browser extensions

```

### Issue: Section animations not triggering

**Possible Causes:**

1. SectionTransition threshold too high
2. Content blocking visibility

**How to Fix:**

```

1. Scroll slowly to ensure 20% of section is visible
2. Check: Section should have wrapping <motion.div>
3. Try: Reload page (Ctrl+R) and scroll again
4. If still broken: Check browser console for Framer Motion errors

```

### Issue: Firebase timeline not loading

**Possible Causes:**

1. Firestore rules blocking read access
2. Collection name mismatch
3. Network error

**How to Fix:**

```

1. Check: "Loading timeline..." message appears (confirms component rendering)
2. Wait: 3-5 seconds for Firestore query
3. If still loading: Check browser console for Firebase errors
4. Fallback: Should show 11 default events if Firestore fails
5. If blank: Check TimelineSection.jsx for errors in console

```
